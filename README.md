## Introduction

Find the nearest movie theaters from your location. Find showtimes in these theaters and view movie information. Built with Flutter with Google Firebase.

## Build Process

- Follow the instructions to [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if you have not done so.
- Run `flutter doctor` to see if any additional steps are needed.
- Update your path to point to 'flutter\bin' where ever you extracted the the file.
- Clone this repo.
- Set up your IDE of choice (Android Studio, XCode, VSCode, etc.)
- `flutter clean` to clean up all previous builds, if any.
- `flutter run` to compile.

## Features

Features inside Find-A-Flick include:
